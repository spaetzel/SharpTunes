SharpTunes
=============

SharpTunes is a small utility providing clean calls to the [iTunes Store Search](http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html) API.

Currently the library supports reading data out of dailymile. OAuth support for posting to the API is coming soon.

View the tests in SharpSpeedConsole/Program.cs for examples on how to use the library
